/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Arjun's Echoes Portfolio App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all user-generated content (portfolio items).
 * Only the authenticated user (Arjun) can create, read, update, or delete data associated with their user ID.
 * The contact form submissions are globally accessible (security managed by Firebase App Check).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}`.  Each user owns a single UserProfile document, and all portfolio content (tech projects, performances, achievements) is stored within subcollections under their profile.
 * Contact form submissions are stored in the top-level `/contact_form_submissions` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - **Strict Ownership**:  Write access to user profiles and their subcollections is restricted to the authenticated user matching the `userId` in the path.
 * - **Public Read for Contact Forms**:  Read access to contact form submissions is public to enable listing. Firebase App Check is used to prevent abuse.
 * - **Denormalization for Authorization**: Each subcollection document contains a `userProfileId` field, matching the `userId` in the path.  This allows us to enforce ownership without additional `get()` calls.
 * - **No User Listing**: Listing all users is not permitted to protect user privacy.
 * - **Immutable `userProfileId`**: The `userProfileId` field in subcollection documents is immutable after creation.
